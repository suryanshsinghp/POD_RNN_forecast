# Forecasting combined with Reduced Order Modeling

This repo contains one of the mini projects for the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics workshop on Hands on Machine Learning for Fluid Dynamics Mini Project. The dataset is not included since it belongs to VKI. The goal was to take the dataset for flow past circular cylinder and construct a Reduced order model using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). Then use the temporal eigenvector of the POD with RNN to predict the evolution of the flow in the lower dimensional space. Then we can use the spatial eigenvectors along with the eigenvalues to get the prediction for the total flow field at a future timesteps. Please check the short [summary](./Summary.pdf)  and the python notebooks part [a](./forecast_till_t_eq_1.ipynb) and [b](./forecast_till_t_eq_3.ipynb).
